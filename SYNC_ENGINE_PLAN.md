# Sync Engine Plan (draft)

Redesign of client state management: consume the event-sourced server that
already exists. Goal: **less code, more reliable** — optimism, reconnect, and
retry become structural guarantees instead of defended special cases.

Status: outline for discussion. Sections marked `TODO` get filled in as we talk.

## 0. Context ledger (receipts — do not lose these)

Facts established by code audit and prototyping, with locations.

### The server is already event-sourced

- Durable per-session event log in SQLite: `event(aggregate_id, seq, type, data)`
  + `event_sequence` counter, unique index `(aggregate_id, seq)`
  (`packages/core/src/event/sql.ts`, migration `20260323234822_events`).
- Event append, projections, and `commit` hooks all run in **one SQLite
  transaction** (`packages/core/src/bus.ts:249-370`, `behavior: "immediate"`).
- 40 of 46 session event types are durable; the 6 ephemeral are streaming
  deltas/progress/usage ticks (`packages/schema/src/session-event.ts:626`).
  Durable events carry complete facts (`text.ended` has full text).
- All hydration tables are written **only** by projectors inside the append
  transaction: `SessionMessageTable`, `SessionTable` → `session/projector.ts`;
  `SessionInboxTable` → `inbox.ts` `project*` fns called only from
  `projector.ts:521,555,571,577`. `SessionPendingTable` is dead (zero writers).
- Message rows carry the aggregate seq of their creating event
  (`projector.ts:386`), and `Session.messages` already paginates by it
  (`session.ts:501`).
- Replay+live log endpoint exists:
  `GET /api/experimental/session/:id/log?after=seq&follow=true`
  (`packages/protocol/src/groups/session.ts:631`). Only devtools consumes it.
- Idempotent admission ~exists: `SessionInbox.admit` (`inbox.ts:137`) adopts an
  existing client-supplied `SessionMessage.ID`, re-checks after conflict
  defects. Gap: adopts without comparing payloads (no conflict on mismatch).
- Reverts are committed server-side inside `Session.prompt`
  (`core/src/session.ts:567` at audit time) — client-side revert.commit is
  already redundant.

### The client ignores all of it

- The client data layer is `packages/client/src/solid/data.ts` (~1,530 lines;
  `packages/tui/src/context/data.tsx` is now a 22-line wrapper) — shared by
  TUI/desktop/web, so the engine lands once for all clients. Three racing
  write paths into one Solid store: a ~60-case bus-event switch, fetch
  handlers doing wholesale `reconcile()`, and (in PR #42807) an optimistic
  ledger both must consult. `sync.complete(key)` markers dedupe fetches but
  are not watermarks.
- Opening a session today = four separate fetches: `session.get`,
  `session.list({parentID})` (children), `session.inbox.list`, messages
  (`data.ts:1084-1140`) — four sync keys, no shared consistent point.
- Reconnect = `sync.reset()` + refetch everything; no gap proof.

### Prior art

- PRs #42807 (optimistic message send) and #42808 (optimistic session create):
  the stopgap. They landed client-generated IDs (keep) and ~15 hand-placed
  guard sites defending the optimistic ledger (delete when this plan ships).
- Prototype: `~/code/open-source/sync-proto` — Effect v4 + Solid. Engine core
  ~200 lines. Six laws as passing tests; seeded 2-client chaos sim (lost
  requests, lost responses after durable write, rejections, connection cuts,
  latency shifts) with convergence / ordering / uniqueness / no-flicker
  invariants; sim caught a real protocol bug (validation-before-adoption) on
  first run. Two-pane demo (await vs optimistic) with narrated scenarios.
- Proposal doc: `~/code/open-source/opencode-sync-proposal/PROPOSAL.md`
  ("Intents, Not Mutations").

### Vocabulary

- **fold** — pure reduction of durable events into state; same meaning on both
  sides. **intent** — a user action not yet acknowledged, client ID, in the
  **outbox**. **watermark** — the aggregate seq a snapshot reflects.
  **echo determinism** — an intent renders byte-identical to the row its
  admission event folds to, so acks are invisible.
- The six laws: idempotency, echo determinism, sync opacity, ordering,
  convergence, failure atomicity.

### Ordering constraint (the one subtle thing)

Watermark reads must share a transaction with row reads:
`seq`-then-rows double-applies accumulators; rows-then-`seq` loses events.

---

## 1. Problem

TODO — expand together. Sketch:

- Optimism, reconnect, and retry are each defended point-by-point instead of
  guaranteed structurally; every new sync path re-fights the same races.
- The client maintains a hand-written mutable mirror of state the server can
  already replay deterministically.

## 2. The claim: less code, more reliable

TODO — expand together. Sketch:

- Fold cases ≈ today's event switch (that code stays, becomes pure).
- Deleted: optimistic ledger + guards, echo replace-in-place, sync-survival
  merges, `submitTails` throttling, `sync.complete` session keys,
  refetch-everything reconnect.
- Added: engine core (~200 lines proven in prototype) + watermark plumbing.
- Reliability from structure: the six laws hold by construction, not vigilance.

## 3. Design

TODO — expand together. Sketch:

```
state  = fold(snapshot, durable events)   server truth only
outbox = ordered pending intents          client IDs, idempotent, serial resend
view   = render(state ⊕ outbox)           derived; ephemeral deltas overlay
```

- Hydrate: `state?recent=N` (snapshot + watermark, one transaction).
- Tail: existing log endpoint after watermark; fold + ack in one store update.
- Reconnect: hydrate → resend unacknowledged → tail. Gapless by construction.
- Scope boundary: session aggregate only. Ambient state (catalog, agents,
  projects, vcs, worktrees) stays on the existing bus as-is.
- Render target: existing Solid store shape, so components don't change.

## 4. Server changes (small)

- S1: watermarked hydration — **decided (tentative, pending prior-art review):**
  one new endpoint, `GET /api/session/:id/snapshot`, one read transaction:

  ```
  { session, children, inbox, messages: last(N), seq }
  ```

  - Named `snapshot`, not `state`: point-in-time consistency is the contract,
    and `state` collides with the engine's `state = fold(...)`.
  - One transaction → one watermark. Rejected alternative: adding `seq` to
    each existing read — three watermarks force per-slice replay guards in
    the engine, and the session row's accumulators (usage sums) double-count
    on overlap replay. Server savings reappear as engine complexity, worse.
  - `children` are info rows only; child sessions are separate aggregates and
    hydrate their own messages/inbox when opened.
  - Older history stays on the existing seq-cursored `messages` endpoint,
    folded in as inert backfill (IDs dedupe; revert/compaction arrive on the
    log).
  - Prior art for snapshot+watermark+tail: Discord (`seq`/RESUME), Telegram
    (`pts`/`getDifference`), Linear (`lastSyncId`), Postgres logical
    replication (exported snapshot + LSN), Kafka/EventStore catch-up
    subscriptions, Replicache (cookie). Slack's deprecated `rtm.start` is the
    cautionary tale for unbounded snapshots. Details: `notes/hydration-prior-art.md`.
- S2: adopt strictness — `admit` conflicts on same-ID/different-payload.
- S3 (later): promote `session.log` out of experimental.

## 5. Migration (each step ships alone)

1. S1 (inert until consumed)
2. S2
3. TUI hydrate+tail behind a flag, same store shape
4. Outbox replaces optimistic ledger; delete guards
5. Reconnect = hydrate+resend+tail; delete refetch machinery

TODO: flag mechanics, rollout, kill criteria per step.

## 6. Validation

- Port sync-proto's six laws + seeded chaos sim to run against the real engine
  with a faked transport. TODO: where these tests live, CI story.

## 7. Open questions (to resolve together)

- Recent-window size for the snapshot (~200? Slack's unbounded-snapshot
  mistake says: bound it from day one).
- Ephemeral delta overlay: exact merge semantics with folded state.
- Compaction / revert / fork: replay interactions worth spelling out?
- Web app / desktop adoption order after TUI.
- What does the devtools log consumer need to stay happy?

## 8. Non-goals

- No server storage migration; no new event types; no runner changes.
- No component/rendering changes; no changes to ambient (non-session) state.
